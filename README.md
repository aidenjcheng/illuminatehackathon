*This entire project was programmed during the allotted time frame of the hackathon*

This project has 3 parts.  This Github repository is the frontend and this repository is the one to download to test the entire program. 
The backend repository (responsible for making the API call): https://github.com/ephemeralwx/illuminateHackathonMLAPI
The actual Machine Learning model was developed with google colab. I took inspiration from a previous notebook and modified the code to increase the # of classes and improve the accuracy. Here is a copy of the google colab project: https://github.com/ephemeralwx/mlmodel

We used Render.com to host the API service.
