Cerebria...

- Utilizes the ResNet50 architecture, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) fine-tuned for detecting and classifying brain tumors with high accuracy

- Uses sophisticated image preprocessing steps like resizing, center cropping, and normalization to increase the model's accuracy in recognizing and classifying brain tumors

- Differentiates between various tumor types (Normal, Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary) and provides confidence scores for each diagnosis, offering reliable and transparent responses

- Features a Flask-based backend with a responsive, scalable API that handles image uploads and returns real-time predictions through an (extremely) user-friendly interface.

- Implements CORS policy to securely manage requests from various origins, ensuring reliable access to the API from different client-side applications.

_This entire project was programmed during the allotted time frame of the hackathon_

This project has 3 parts. This Github repository is the frontend and this repository is the one to download to test the entire program.

The backend repository (responsible for making the API call): https://github.com/ephemeralwx/illuminateHackathonMLAPI
The actual Machine Learning model was developed with google colab. I took inspiration from a previous notebook and modified the code to increase the # of classes and improve the accuracy. Here is a copy of the google colab project: https://github.com/ephemeralwx/mlmodel

Tools we used/tech stack:
We used Render.com to host the API service.
Tailwind, GSAP for the frontend
Python Flask for the backend

GSAP Documentation
Flask Documentation
